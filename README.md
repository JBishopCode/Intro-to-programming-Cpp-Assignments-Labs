#Intro to Programming C++ Assignments and Labs

This repository holds all of my C++ course work.
Each assignment/lab sits in its own folder.
Overall, there is 6 Assignments and 4 Labs.
Some Assignments/Labs are missing due to being done on another software (QT) so I couldnt import them onto here.
The main branch stores every assignment and lab in one place.

**Structure**

Assignments
Labs

Each folder includes code, notes, and any build files needed for that task.

**How to use this repo**

1. Open either the /Assignment folder or the /Labs folder

2. Pick out whatever Assignment/Lab you want to view

3. Read instructions/details on how the assignment/lab works and how to run it

4. Follow Instructions
