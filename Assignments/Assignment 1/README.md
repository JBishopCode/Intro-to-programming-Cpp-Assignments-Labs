In this assignment we were tasked to write a program that guesses the user's number. 

The user is asked to pick a number between 1 - 1000. From there the program will use 10 guesses or less to guess your number. 

To run the code, you have to use the guess.exe file followed by your number. 

For example, ".\guess.exe 473"
